# cfg_rust_features

TODO

## Motivation

TODO: Convenient for having cond-comp that can detect when previously-unstable features become
stabilized (e.g. to adjust to use a new feature instead of previous workarounds).

TODO: More convenient than autocfg or version_check, when my goals are desired

## Examples

TODO: plural

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust 1.0.0 will always be supported, so this crate can be used by other crates which support that
old version.

## Documentation

The source-code has doc comments, which are rendered as the API documentation.

View online at: <http://docs.rs/cfg_rust_features>
